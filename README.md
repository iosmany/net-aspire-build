NetAspire9 is a project that implements Event-Driven Design and Clean Architecture principles to build scalable and maintainable systems. This repository demonstrates the separation of concerns, with a focus on domain-driven design, event sourcing, and decoupling of components through asynchronous messaging patterns. The architecture supports high flexibility and scalability, allowing for easy adaptation to new requirements. It leverages modern technologies and design patterns to ensure the system is both robust and testable.
